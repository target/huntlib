class ElasticDF(object):
    '''
    The ElasticDF() class searches Elastic and returns results as a Pandas
    DataFrame.  This makes it easier to work with the search results with
    standard data analysis techniques.

    Example usage:

        # Create a plaintext connection to the Elastic server, no authentication
        e = ElasticDF(url="http://localhost:9200")

        # The same, but with SSL and authentication
        e = ElasticDF(url="https://localhost:9200", ssl=True, username="myuser",
                      password="mypass")

        # Fetch search results from an index or index pattern for the previous day
        df = e.search_df(lucene="item:5282 AND color:red", index="myindex-*", days=1)

        # The same, but do not flatten structures into individual columns.
        # This will result in each structure having a single column with a
        # JSON string describing the structure.
        df = e.search_df(lucene="item:5282 AND color:red", index="myindex-*", days=1,
                         normalize=False)

        # A more complex example, showing how to set the Elastic document type,
        # use Python-style datetime objects to constrain the search to a certain
        # time period, and a user-defined field against which to do the time
        # comparisons.
        df = e.search_df(lucene="item:5285 AND color:red", index="myindex-*",
                         doctype="doc", date_field="mydate",
                         start_time=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=8),
                         end_time=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=6))

    The search() and search_df() methods will raise
    InvalidRequestSearchException() in the event that the search request is
    syntactically correct but is otherwise invalid. For example, if you request
    more results be returned than the server is able to provide.
    They will raise AuthenticationErrorSearchException() in the event the server 
    denied the credentials during login.  They can also raise an
    UnknownSearchException() for other situations, in which case the exception
    message will contain the original error message returned by Elastic so you
    can figure out what went wrong.
